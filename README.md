# Java Programs (College Coursework)

A collection of Java programs and personal notes from my college coursework.  
This repo is mainly for **practice + revision**, and to show my progress in **Core Java, OOP, and basic Data Structures/Algorithms**.

## What’s inside

### ✅ Java Programs
Examples and practice programs covering:
- Java fundamentals (variables, loops, methods)
- OOP (classes/objects, constructors, overloading, inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces)
- Arrays / ArrayLists
- Searching & Sorting (Linear/Binary Search, Selection/Insertion Sort, etc.)
- Exception handling
- File I/O (streams, reading input)
- Small mini-programs / labs / exam practice

### 📚 Notes (PDF/DOCX)
I also keep some topic notes as PDFs (and a few DOCX files), organized like:
- `notes/Chapter 5 6/` — constructor overloading, method overloading, enums, getters/setters, wrapper classes, etc.
- `notes/Chapter 7/` — arrays
- `notes/Chapter 8/` — abstraction, inheritance, interfaces, polymorphism
- `notes/Chapter 9/` — exceptions
- `notes/Chapter 10/` — I/O streams, Scanner, serialization
- `notes/Data Structure/` — search, sort, stacks (basics)

> If any PDF contains professor slides/textbook pages, it’s safer to keep this repository **PRIVATE**.
